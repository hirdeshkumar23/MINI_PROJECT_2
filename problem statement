1. AI-Powered Product Condition Verification for Safer E-
Commerce

1. Introduction
With the rapid growth of online marketplaces, the sale of used, refurbished, and
open-box products has become increasingly common. While this creates affordable
options for buyers, it also introduces a major challenge — trust. Buyers often
hesitate to purchase damaged or refurbished items because product condition is
poorly described, images can be misleading, and the term “damaged” does not
explain the actual usability of a product.
TrustLens AI is proposed as an intelligent system that uses artificial intelligence to
analyze product images, clearly explain their condition, and help buyers and
sellers make informed decisions. The goal of this project is to bridge the trust gap
in e-commerce by making product condition verification transparent, reliable, and
easy to understand.

2. Problem Statement
Current e-commerce platforms suffer from several limitations when handling
damaged or second-hand products:
 Product damage is usually marked as a simple “damaged” or “undamaged”
label, which lacks clarity
 Buyers cannot easily judge whether the damage affects usability
 Sellers struggle to price damaged items fairly
 Fake, reused, or edited images reduce marketplace credibility
 Disputes and returns increase operational costs
These issues result in low buyer confidence, frequent disputes, and inefficient
manual verification processes.

3. Proposed Solution
TrustLens AI provides an AI-driven product condition verification system that
automatically evaluates product images and presents clear, human-readable
insights. Instead of relying on manual checks or vague descriptions, the system
analyzes visual damage, estimates its severity, explains its impact, and supports fair
pricing decisions.
By combining computer vision, language models, and intelligent automation,
TrustLens AI transforms product listings into transparent and trustworthy
representations.

4. Key Objectives
 Improve buyer trust in refurbished and damaged product listings
 Provide clear explanations of product condition in simple language
 Assist sellers in setting fair and realistic prices
 Detect image fraud and misleading listings
 Reduce disputes and manual moderation effort
 Create a scalable and intelligent trust layer for e-commerce platforms

5. Key Features
i. AI Damage Severity Analysis
The system identifies damaged areas in product images and categorizes
them into different severity levels such as minor cosmetic damage or
functional risk. Each result is accompanied by a simple explanation that helps
buyers understand whether the damage affects daily use.
ii. AI-Based Price Recommendation
Based on the detected damage severity and market data, the system
suggests a fair price for the product. This helps sellers price items accurately
and buyers feel confident that they are paying a reasonable amount.
iii. Image Authenticity and Fraud Detection
TrustLens AI checks whether images are reused, duplicated, or digitally
altered. This protects the platform from fraudulent listings and builds long-term
buyer trust.
iv. Human-Readable Condition Explanation
Instead of technical bounding boxes or model outputs, the system generates
easy-to-understand descriptions of the product’s condition and can respond to
buyer questions through an AI-powered chat interface.
v. Seller Trust Intelligence
The platform evaluates seller behavior over time, considering factors such as
disclosure accuracy and dispute history, and assigns a trust score that buyers
can view before making a purchase.
vi. AI-Assisted Dispute Resolution
In case of disputes, the system re-analyzes images and generates evidence-
based reports, reducing the need for manual intervention.
6. Real-Time Use Case
A seller uploads images of a refurbished smartphone to the platform. TrustLens AI
automatically detects minor scratches on the back panel, classifies the damage as
cosmetic, and generates a clear explanation stating that the device’s functionality is
unaffected. The system then recommends a slightly discounted price and verifies
that the uploaded images are authentic.

When a buyer views the listing, they see a transparent condition explanation, a fair
price suggestion, and a seller trust score. This clarity increases buyer confidence
and reduces the likelihood of returns or disputes.

7. Conclusion
TrustLens AI moves beyond basic damage detection and introduces a complete AI-
powered trust solution for e-commerce platforms. By providing accurate
condition analysis, clear explanations, fraud prevention, and pricing support, the
system enhances transparency for buyers and credibility for sellers. This project
demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied in a practical, real-world
setting to solve one of the most important challenges in online commerce — trust.
